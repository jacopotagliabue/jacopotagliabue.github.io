## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a [NLP / IR startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso).

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap from scale-up to IPO, and built out Coveo Labs, an [applied R&D practice](https://medium.com/the-techlife/applied-research-at-reasonable-scale-8a74d2beed89) rooted in collaboration (e.g. [Stanford](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9), [Netflix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11761.pdf), [Farfetch](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ecnlp-1.22/), [NVIDIA](https://rdcu.be/c4dXy)), [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge) - our libraries, models and datasets have collected thousands of stars and garnered millions of downloads.

I recently started investing in tech startups, both directly and as LP in AI funds: I'm always happy to chat with founders about DataOps, MLOps and AI.

While building [Bauplan](https://www.bauplanlabs.com/), I moonlight as [Adj. Professor of ML at NYU](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022), which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand.

### Where is my mind?

I occasionally share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [teaching materials](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/).

I talk _a lot_, and I'm sometimes invited to do so by friends in industry (e.g. talks at Home Depot, Lowe's, Farfetch, eBay, Pinterest) and research (e.g. keynotes at [KDD](public/ADKDD_talk_Aug_2023.pdf), [SIRIP](public/SIRIP_2023_keynote.pdf), [RecSys](https://orsum.inesctec.pt/orsum2023/keynote.php)): some of my talks and papers are highlighted [at the end of this page](#appendix).

### Research-y stuff

Most of my research sits at the intersection of language, learning and retrieval, with a recent drift towards [data processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05368).

I am co-organizer of SIGIR eCom (2022, 2023), EvalRS (2022, 2023), Industry Sponsorship Chair for CIKM 2022, and I've been in the program committee for many conferences (COLING, ECONLP, ECNLP, EMNLP, ACL, SIRIP). My work has been presented in venues such as [NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [WWW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963), [RecSys](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477) and [Nature journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9): our paper on [cognitively-inspired query embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-industry.20/) won the Best Paper Award at NAACL 21.

As a true [SFI alumnus](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), I am an old-fashioned generalist, and I gave tiny contributions to other fields mostly as a way to spend more time with old friends: [data systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05368), [logic and computation](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/32/6/1129/6548838?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [cellular automata](https://philpapers.org/archive/BERTPO-77.pdf), computational social sciences, [networks](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0029-0), [philosophy of mind](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-013-9332-4), [political science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23248823.2023.2175124), [digital ethics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-023-09644-y).

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., simulate a pre-Columbian civilization, document biases in national elections and give an academic talk on videogames. Some of my improbable "achievements" received [ample](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) [press](public/il_foglio_02_2023.pdf) [coverage](public/isport_gazzetta.pdf) in national outlets. 

Having built end-to-end data and ML pipelines at garage, growth and IPO scale, I happily shared all my mistakes in a series of [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops) that introduced the concept of _Reasonable Scale_.

Some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led one of the first attempts of running sophisticated analytics for a professional basketball [team](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/), and spearheaded the first [data science](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf) (no bikers or bureaucrats were harmed during the project).

Aside from research and tutorials, our datasets have been successfully used by dozens of master students to defend their thesis at Tillburg University and Politecnico in Milan.
