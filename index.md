## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, [SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a [NLP / IR startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso). 

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap through _Coveo Labs_, an applied R&D practice and a network of word-class collaborations (Stanford, Bocconi, Oxford, Uber, Microsoft, NVIDIA) built on [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

I talk _a lot_, and I'm often invited to do so by folks in industry (BBC, Walmart, Pinterest, Tubi, eBay, Farfetch) and academia (SIRIP, CiE, KDD, Stanford, Harvard Medical School) [ _yes_, you can invite me too, if you ask nicely! ].

I am currently an Adj. Professor of [ML](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/FREE_7773) at NYU, which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand.

### Where is my mind?

I share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en), [thoughts](https://medium.com/@jacopotagliabue) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/jacopotagliabue) (ORDER BY importance DESC); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/). Very recent stuff you may be looking for here:

* Join us at [CIKM 2022 EvalRS Challenge](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/)!
* My latest open source work, [RecList](http://reclist.io/), got three sponsors to fund its development (I'm genuinely amazed and moved by how cool the MLOps community is).
* My keynote at the _NVIDIA RecSys Summit_ is now [available](https://youtu.be/9rouLchcC0k?t=147) ([slides](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/recs-at-resonable-scale/blob/main/slides/NVIDIA_RECSYS_SUMMIT_JT.pdf), [repo](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/recs-at-resonable-scale)).
* Our work in multi-modal models is [out as a pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03972).

## Current stuff

### RecList and MLOps "at reasonable scale"

I have an ongoing project with [Federico Bianchi](https://federicobianchi.io/) (and friends) on behavioral testing for recommender systems: [RecList](http://reclist.io/) spawned a popular [open source package](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist), a [code competition](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/) at CIKM, and a [scholarly paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963) at the WebConf.

Having built end-to-end systems at garage, scale-up and IPO scale, I had the privilege of making a lot of mistakes in most parts of the DataOps and MLops stack. To share my learnings, I introduced the concept of "[reasonable scale](https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-at-reasonable-scale) ML" in a series of open source [repositories](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/recs-at-resonable-scale), [papers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460231.3474604) and [walkthroughs](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops), starting with the motto "[You don't need a bigger boat](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat)".

If you prefer videos, and you're done with all five seasons of Rick & Morty, my [Stanford MLSys Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndxpo4PeEms),[NVIDIA keynote](https://youtu.be/9rouLchcC0k?t=147), or [StitchFix Algo Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAlJYxFYA04) are the best places to start. 

### A.I. research

_To be continued: come back often for updates_

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements").

_iSport_: some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led the data team that re-engineered [Olimpia Milano](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/) workflow for the analysis of basketball data. [iSport](public/isport_gazzetta.pdf) was the first attempt in Italy (and one of the first worldwide) of running sophisticated analytics for basketball teams.

_pedalaMI_: I led the first data analysis and [vizualization](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's public [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf), which received plenty of [national press](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) coverage. No bikers (and no bureaucrats) were harmed for the project.

_SEP_: together with [Franz Berto](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96) I'm a proud author of [Cellular Automata](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/) on the Stanford Encyclopedia, which may well be "the most interesting website [on the internet](https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/" (or not).
