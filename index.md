## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, [SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a NLP / IR startup in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso). 

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap through _Coveo Labs_, an applied R&D practice and a network of word-class collaborations (Stanford, Bocconi, Oxford, Uber, Microsoft, NVIDIA) built on [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

I talk _a lot_, and I'm often invited to do so by folks in industry (BBC, Walmart, Pinterest, Tubi, eBay, NVIDIA) and academia (SIRIP, CiE, KDD) [ _yes_, you can invite me too, if you ask nicely! ].

I am currently an Adj. Professor of [ML](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/FREE_7773) at NYU, which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand.

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to do scienc-y things for a professional basketball team, simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements").
