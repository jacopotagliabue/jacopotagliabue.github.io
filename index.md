## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a [NLP / IR startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso). 

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap from scale-up to IPO, and built out _Coveo Labs_, an [applied R&D practice](https://medium.com/the-techlife/applied-research-at-reasonable-scale-8a74d2beed89) rooted in collaboration (e.g. [Stanford](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9), [Bocconi](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477), [Outerbounds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13601.pdf), [Farfetch](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ecnlp-1.22/), [Microsoft](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/32/6/1129/6548838?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [NVIDIA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0)), [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

I'm currently a proud NLP advisor for [Civic Eagle](https://www.civiceagle.com/), and also Adj. Professor of ML at NYU, which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand. I'm building a new company now and I'm always happy to chat about DataOps, MLOps and NLP.

### Where is my mind?

I occasionally share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [teaching material](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/).

I talk _a lot_, and I am often asked to do so in industry (BBC, Walmart, Pinterest, eBay, Farfetch, etc.) and academia (SIRIP, CiE, KDD, Stanford, etc.): popular talks, papers and datasets are highlighted (for the brave reader) [at the very end of this page](#appendix).

## Current stuff

### RecList and MLOps "at reasonable scale"

[RecList](http://reclist.io/) is a testing library for recommender systems: RecList spawned a popular [open source package](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist), a [CIKM competition](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/), and and few papers ([WWW](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3487553.3524215), [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0). RecList successfully raised funds from MLOps companies to sponsor its open development.

Having built end-to-end systems at garage, scale-up and IPO scale, I had the privilege of making a lot of mistakes in DataOps and MLops. To share my learnings, I introduced the _Reasonable Scale_ ML in "[You don't need a bigger boat](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat)" (and  related [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops)).

_Current interests_: ML testing, developing in the Modern Data Stack. 

### A.I. research

My recent research is in (mostly) applied and (sometimes) theoretical topics at the intersection of language, learning and retrieval. 

I am co-organizer of SIGIR eCom, Industry Sponsorship Chair for CIKM 2022, and I've been involved in organizing many NLP events (COLING, ECONLP, ECNLP, EMNLP). My work has been presented in venues such as [NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [WWW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963), [RecSys](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477) and [Nature journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9): our work on [cognitively-inspired query embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-industry.20/) won the Best Paper Award at NAACL 21.

As a true [SFI alumnus](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), I am an old-fashioned generalist, and I gave small contributions to a bunch of topics outside "traditional A.I.": archeology, [agent-based models](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0029-0), [philosophy of mind](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-013-9332-4), political science.

_Current interests_: multi-modal representations.

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., work for a professional basketball team, simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements"). 

Some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led one of the first [attempts](public/isport_gazzetta.pdf) of running sophisticated analytics for a professional basketball [team](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/). 

I also led the first data analysis and [vizualization](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf), which received plenty of [press](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) coverage. No bikers (and no bureaucrats) were harmed for the project.
