## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a [NLP / IR startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso). 

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap through _Coveo Labs_, an applied R&D practice and a network of word-class collaborations (Stanford, Bocconi, Oxford, Uber, Microsoft, NVIDIA) built on [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

I talk _a lot_, and I'm often invited to do so by folks in industry (BBC, Walmart, Pinterest, Tubi, eBay, Farfetch) and academia (SIRIP, CiE, KDD, Stanford, Harvard Medical School) [ _yes_, you can invite me too, if you ask nicely! ].

I am currently an Adj. Professor of [ML](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/FREE_7773) at NYU, which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand.

### Where is my mind?

I share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en), [thoughts](https://medium.com/@jacopotagliabue) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/jacopotagliabue) (ORDER BY importance DESC); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/). Very recent announcements you may be looking for:

* My latest open source work, [RecList](http://reclist.io/), got three sponsors to fund its development (I'm genuinely amazed and moved by how cool the MLOps community is).
* My keynote at the _NVIDIA RecSys Summit 2022_ is now [available](https://youtu.be/9rouLchcC0k?t=147) with [slides](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/recs-at-resonable-scale/blob/main/slides/NVIDIA_RECSYS_SUMMIT_JT.pdf).
* Join us at [CIKM 2022 EvalRS Challenge](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/)!

## Current stuff

### RecList and MLOps "at reasonable scale"

I have an ongoing project with [Federico Bianchi](https://federicobianchi.io/) (and friends) on behavioral testing for recommender systems: [RecList](http://reclist.io/) spawned a popular [open source package](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist), a [CIKM competition](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/), hours of English-with-an-Italian-accent (e.g. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAlJYxFYA04)), and a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963) at WWW 2022.

Having built end-to-end systems at garage, scale-up and IPO scale, I had the privilege of making a lot of mistakes in most parts of the DataOps and MLops stack. To share my learnings, I introduced the concept of "reasonable scale ML" in a series of open source [repositories](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/recs-at-resonable-scale) and [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops) ("[You don't need a bigger boat](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat)").

If you prefer videos, and you're done with all five seasons of Rick & Morty, my [Stanford MLSys Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndxpo4PeEms) and [NVIDIA keynote](https://youtu.be/9rouLchcC0k?t=147) are the best places to start. 

_Current interests_: ML testing, developing in the Modern Data Stack, improving SQL (?). 

### A.I. research

My recent research is in (mostly) applied and (sometimes) theoretical topics at the intersection of language, learning and retrieval. 

I am co-organizer of SIGIR eCom, committee member for several NLP events (ECONLP, ECNLP, EMNLP Industry) and I have published in top-tier venues and journals (NAACL, ACL, WWW, RecSys, etc.): our collaboration with Federico Bianchi on cognitively-inspired query embeddings won the Best Paper Award at NAACL 21. Some highlights include:

* ["Does it come in black?" CLIP-like models are zero-shot recommenders](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ecnlp-1.22/) (ACL 22)
* [Query2Prod2Vec: Grounded Word Embeddings for eCommerce](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-industry.20/) (NAACL 21, Best Paper Award)
* [Language in a (Search) Box: Grounding Language Learning in Real-World Human-Machine Interaction](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/) (NAACL 21)
* [The Embeddings That Came in From the Cold: Improving Vectors for New and Rare Products with Content-Based Inference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477) (RecSys 2020)

As a true [SFI alumnus](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), I am an old-fashioned generalist, and I gave small contributions as papers, projects or reviews to a bunch of topics outside of "traditional A.I.": computational social sciences, [agent-based models](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0029-0), urban studies, [philosophy of mind](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-013-9332-4).

_Current interests_: multi-modal representations, making logic great again.

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements").

_iSport_: some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led the first [attempt in Italy](public/isport_gazzetta.pdf) (and one of the first worldwide) of running sophisticated analytics for a professional basketball [team](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/).

_pedalaMI_: I led the first data analysis and [vizualization](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf), which received plenty of [press](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) coverage. No bikers (and no bureaucrats) were harmed for the project.

_SEP_: together with [Franz Berto](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96) I'm a proud author of [Cellular Automata](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/) on the Stanford Encyclopedia, "the most interesting website [on the internet](https://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/)" (or not).
