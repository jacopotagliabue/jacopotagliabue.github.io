## Apo's Stuff

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, [SFI](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso. Tooso was proudly serving predictions to dozens of millions of shoppers per year, before being acquired by TSX:CVO in [2019](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso).

I served as Coveo's Director of A.I. for three years, combining product thinking and research-like curiosity to build better data-driven systems at scale. I am a huge fan of open science and open source, and divide my days between research, product and evangelization (through code, datasets and talks). 

I spend quite some time bridging the gap between academia and industry research, and between research and business: while pursuing my agenda in language and reasoning, I teach NLP and MLSys at NYU. In previous lives, I managed to do scienc-y things for a professional basketball team, simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements"). 

My A.I. work has been featured several times in the general press and presented in business and academic venues (including WWW, ACL, RecSys, SIGIR, NeurIPS, as well as winning best paper at NAACL).
