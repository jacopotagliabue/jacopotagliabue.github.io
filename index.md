## My name is Apo and I'm a mighty pirate

Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), I was co-founder and CTO of Tooso, a [NLP / IR startup](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3913700/cool-vendors-in-digital-commerce) in San Francisco acquired by [TSX:CVO](https://www.coveo.com/en/company/news-releases/2019/coveo-acquires-tooso). 

I led Coveo's A.I. and MLOps roadmap from scale-up to IPO, and built out _Coveo Labs_, an [applied R&D practice](https://medium.com/the-techlife/applied-research-at-reasonable-scale-8a74d2beed89) rooted in collaboration (e.g. [Stanford](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9), [Outerbounds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.13601.pdf), [Farfetch](https://aclanthology.org/2022.ecnlp-1.22/), [Microsoft](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/32/6/1129/6548838?redirectedFrom=fulltext), [NVIDIA](https://rdcu.be/c4dXy)), [open source](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue) and [open science](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge).

Having built end-to-end systems at garage, growth and IPO scale, I had the privilege of making a lot of mistakes: I shared my learnings on _Reasonable Scale_ Machine Learning in a series of [articles](https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/mlops-without-much-ops) and repos.

I'm a proud NLP advisor for [Civic Eagle](https://www.civiceagle.com/), and also Adj. Professor of ML at NYU, which is mostly notable because it is the only job I ever had that my parents (sort of) understand. I'm building a new company now and I'm always happy to chat about DataOps, MLOps and NLP.

### Where is my mind?

I occasionally share [code](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue), [ideas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NDX19U0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [teaching materials](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2022); if you have no intention of selling me anything, you can also try me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopotagliabue/).

I talk _a lot_, and I'm sometimes asked to do so both by friends in industry - from startups to Fortune 500 - and academia: popular projects and papers are highlighted (for the brave reader) [at the end of this page](#appendix).

### A.I. research

My recent research is in (mostly) applied and (sometimes) theoretical topics at the intersection of language, learning and retrieval. 

I am co-organizer of SIGIR eCom, Industry Sponsorship Chair for CIKM 2022, and I've been involved in many NLP and IR events (COLING, ECONLP, ECNLP, EMNLP, SIRIP). My work has been presented in venues such as [NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/), [WWW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09963), [RecSys](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3383313.3411477) and [Nature journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23052-9): our paper on [cognitively-inspired query embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-industry.20/) won the Best Paper Award at NAACL 21.

As a true [SFI alumnus](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/alumni/jacopo-tagliabue), I am an old-fashioned generalist, and I gave small contributions to a bunch of topics outside "traditional A.I.": computational social sciences, [agent-based models](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0029-0), [philosophy of mind](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-013-9332-4), [political science](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367524368_Voting_fast_and_slow_Ballot_order_and_likeability_effects_in_the_Five_Star_Movement's_2012_online_primary_election).

## Old stuff

In previous lives, I managed to get a Ph.D., simulate a pre-Columbian civilization and give an academic talk on videogames (among others improbable "achievements"). 

Some time before [Brad Pitt's movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)), I led one of the first [attempts](public/isport_gazzetta.pdf) of running sophisticated analytics for a professional basketball [team](http://www.olimpiamilano.com/en/). 

I also led the first data analysis and [vizualization](https://vimeo.com/74664341) effort on Milan's [bike-sharing service](public/PedalaMi.pdf), which received plenty of [press](http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_settembre_18/ciclobby-censimento-biciclette-mobilita-sostenibile-2223163930809.shtml) coverage. No bikers (and no bureaucrats) were harmed for the project.

## Appendix

Quick links to selected projects, talks, papers, datasets: if there's a paper, talk, deck you know I have, but you can't find it (here or elsewhere), please do get in touch directly.

### Selected open source projects

* [RecList](http://reclist.io/) is a testing library for recommender systems: RecList spawned a sponsored [open source package](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/reclist), a [CIKM competition](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/), and few papers ([WWW](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3487553.3524215), [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00606-0), [CIKM Workshop](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3318/keynote3.pdf)).
* "[You don't need a bigger boat](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat)" is a (very opinionated) introduction to modern pipelines at the Reasonable Scale, first presented at the [Stanford MLSys Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndxpo4PeEms) in 2021. A simpler setup, based on the same principles, can be found in the [Post-Modern Data Stack](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/post-modern-stack) project.

Aside from research and tutorials, our datasets have been successfully used by dozens of master students to defend their thesis at Tillburg University and Politecnico in Milan.
